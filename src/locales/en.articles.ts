      "As the cryptoeconomy grows and evolves, there are more ways than ever to earn rewards for holding crypto, learning about crypto, or interacting with decentralized finance (or DeFi) apps. Most of these opportunities are available right inside the main Ai Earn app or website, while the last one requires the use of a wallet with a DeFi browser built in, like Ai Earn Wallet . We’ll walk you through the basics of some of the best ways to grow your crypto via rewards right now.",
      "1. Ai Earn learning rewards",
      "The easiest way to start generating crypto rewards on Ai Earn is through Ai Earn Earn. In exchange for learning the basics about certain cryptocurrencies (usually by watching short videos), you can get some to try for yourself.",
      "Since the launch of Ai Earn Earn in 2018, users have received more than $100 million in crypto including 0x, Basic Attention Token, Zcash, Stellar Lumens, EOS, Dai, Tezos, Orchid, Compound, Celo, Nucypher, and the Graph.",
      "2. Stake some of your crypto",
      "Many cryptocurrencies now use a \"Proof of Stake\" consensus mechanism — which is a way their decentralized networks can ensure that all transactions are verified and secured without a bank orpayment processor in the middle.",
      "With such cryptocurrencies, you can earn rewards simply for contributing to the security of the network — by \"locking\" some of your holdings into a staking pool for a certain timeframe. In exchange, you’ll earn rewards. This is an excellent option if you were planning to hold onto the crypto for a longer period — instead of having it sit idle, you can put it to work for you.",
      "Via the main Ai Earn app or website, eligible users can stake Tezos, Cosmos, or ETH and earn as much as 5% interest (depending on the type of asset being staked) as of June 2021. Visit Ai Earn.com/staking to learn more.",
      "3. Turn your dollars into stablecoins",
      "One potential downside of staking rewards is that they’re paid in the native cryptocurrency, which can be volatile. But you can earn rewards simply by buying and holding dollar-pegged stablecoins like Dai and USD Coin (USDC).",
      "As of June 2021, you can earn 2.00% APY rewards by simply holding Dai in your Ai Earn account. You can also earn 0.15% APY for holding USD Coin — and can earn even more via USDC Lending (see tip No. 4).",
      "4. Lend some of your crypto with CeFi",
      "It can be challenging at times to hold dollars in a traditional savings account and earn meaningful yield. But stablecoins have made a very similar proposition possible. A growing number of centralized finance (or CeFi) products have emerged that provide compelling yield for keeping some of your crypto holdings in stablecoin form. Ai Earn customers looking for a low-risk investment can start earning 4.00% APY via USDC. Crypto deposits aren’t insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or SIPC.",
      "5. Lend some of your crypto with DeFi apps",
      "If you’re comfortable with higher potential risks for higher returns, you can experiment with lending some of your crypto via DeFi apps. (DeFi remains an emerging technology, so make sure not to invest more than you can afford to lose if you decide to experiment with these protocols.)",
      "DeFi can enable transparent, peer-to-peer lending for potentially higher yields than traditional financial offerings. Investors that supply their cryptocurrency to DeFi lending protocols receive rewards in the form of interest that is charged to borrowers. You need a crypto wallet that is compatible with DeFi apps. Ai Earn Wallet (which is a separate product from the main Ai Earn app and can be used by anyone, not just Ai Earn customers).Via Ai Earn Wallet, you can experiment with lending some of your crypto — the simplest way to start is with a stablecoin — via DeFi protocols such as Compound or Aave.",

We’re separating fact from fiction — without shying away from legitimate risks — to get to the truth about the world’s most popular cryptocurrency.",
      "Myth #1: Bitcoin is a bubble",
      "While it’s true that some people buy Bitcoin as a speculative investment seeking big returns, that doesn’t mean that Bitcoin itself is a bubble.",
      " Bubbles are economic cycles characterized by unsustainable rises in market value. ",
      "They eventually pop when investors realize prices are much higher than an asset’s fundamental value. Bitcoin is occasionally compared to an infamous early speculative bubble: the 17th century Dutch \"tulip mania.\" In 1637, speculators caused prices for some tulip varieties to surge 26-fold. The bubble lasted six months, crashed, and never recovered.",
      "The real story: ",
      "Bitcoin has gone through multiple price cycles over the course of over 12 years — and has recovered each time to achieve new highs. As with any new technology, boom and bust cycles are expected. For example, at the end of the dot.com era in the nineties, Amazon stock nosedived from around $100 to just $5, only to become one of the most valuable companies in the world in the subsequent decades.",
      "Some major Bitcoin investors believe that Bitcoin’s oscillations form a pattern typical of young markets. Bitcoin, they say, will surge and recede with smaller swings and longer durations between them until at some point in the future it settles into relative stability. But only time will tell.",
      "Myth #2: Bitcoin has no real-world uses",
      "Critics like to claim that Bitcoin isn’t useful in the real world — or if it does have a use, it’s mostly useful for illicit activity. Neither of those statements are true.",
      " Bitcoin has a long history as a means of making payments to anyone in the world, all without a bank or payment processor in the middle ",
      ". And it is increasingly being used as a gold-like hedge against inflation by major institutional investors.",
      "The real story: ",
      "In recent years, Bitcoin has become increasingly popular as an inflation-resistant store of value much like gold — leading to Bitcoin’s \"digital gold\" nickname. A growing number of major funds and publicly traded companies (Tesla, Square, MicroStrategy) have bought millions or even billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin as a means to better manage their assets.",
      "Much like gold, Bitcoin is scarce (there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin). Gold, of course, is heavy, bulky, and difficult to transport and store. Bitcoin, on the other hand, can be sent digitally as easily as sending an email.",
      "Bitcoin received negative attention in early years as a means of payment on the dark web. But when the first big dark-web market was shuttered, Bitcoin prices went up after just a few days — and continued to rise.",
      "Like any form of money, some of it will be misused. But compared to US dollars, illicit use of Bitcoin is a drop in the bucket. According to a recent report, 2.1% of Bitcoin transaction volume in 2019 was related to criminal enterprise.",
      "And because all Bitcoin transactions happen on an open blockchain, it’s often easier for authorities to track illicit activity than it would be in the traditional financial system.",
      "Myth #3: Bitcoin doesn’t have real value",
      "While Bitcoin might not be backed by a physical asset like gold, neither is the US dollar or virtually any other modern fiat currency.",
      " Bitcoin is hard-coded to be scarce, which helps make it resistant to inflation ",
      ". Inflation with fiat currencies can occur when large quantities are created, thus diluting the existing supply .",
      "The real story: ",
      "There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. This scarcity is a major driver of its value.",
      "Not only is the supply capped, but the amount of new Bitcoin being mined is declining over time in a predictable way. Every four years, in an event called a \"halving,\" block rewards paid to miners in the network are cut in half.",
      "This helps ensure that the supply is always reducing which, by the basic economic principle of scarcity, has worked to keep the price of Bitcoin broadly trending upwards over the long-term — from less than a penny at the start to more than $50,000 as of mid-February, 2021. (See Bitcoin’s current price.)",
      "Bitcoin also derives value from the work the computers on the network contribute via a process called mining. Powerful computers all over the world supply a vast amount of processing power towards the work of validating and securing every transaction (in exchange they’re rewarded with new Bitcoin).",
      "Myth #4: Bitcoin will just be replaced by a competitor",
      "Bitcoin was the first really successful digital money. And while",
      " new cryptocurrencies have long promised to overtake Bitcoin via new features or other advantages, none have come close ",
      "The real story: ",
      "Though thousands of rival cryptocurrencies have been created over the past decade, Bitcoin has always been and remains the most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap by a significant margin.",
      "It’s also the most popular, making up around 60% of the crypto market.",
      "Reasons include Bitcoin’s \"first-mover\" advantage, along with the purity of its mission as a decentralized and open currency.",
      "Which isn’t to say that competitors aren’t welcome to try. Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning it’s operated by a global community of miners and nodes, instead of a central authority.",
      "For example, if Bitcoin’s underlying architecture has to change in order to add new functionality, features, or to protect against a newly-discovered bug, the community can initiate a fork to upgrade the network.",
      "In order for the upgrade to be accepted, a 51% majority of the community must support the change. This allows Bitcoin to adapt and evolve as required, as seen with Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness (“SegWit”) upgrade in 2017.",
      "Because the software is open-source, developers who aren’t able to gain community consensus can even create a hard-fork of the Bitcoin blockchain and make an entirely new cryptocurrency. For instance, Bitcoin Cash was created this way — but so far no Bitcoin clones have come anywhere close to replacing the original.",
      "Of course, a huge amount of innovation is happening in the space, so it’s conceivable that a bigger rival could emerge. But given current circumstances most experts don’t think Bitcoin being replaced anytime soon is a likely outcome.",
      "Myth #5: Investing in Bitcoin is gambling",
      "While it’s true that Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility over the last decade, that’s to be expected of a young and growing market. Since Bitcoin’s genesis block in 2010, it has steadily gained long-term value — with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion (as of February 2021; see the current market cap). And",
      " as Bitcoin has continued to mature, a robust regulatory structure in countries around the world has helped to attract a wave of institutional investment ",
      "(Tesla, hedge funds).",
      "The whole story: ",
      "There is a fundamental rationale for a Bitcoin investor to believe that the value of their holdings should rise — whereas in a casino you know the odds are tilted in favor of the house. Of course there is no guarantee about future performance or continued results, but Bitcoin’s long term trendline over the last decade has been upward.",
      "One popular investing strategy for reducing the impact of volatility is dollar-cost averaging — in which you invest a fixed amount every week or month no matter what the market is doing. This strategy typically results in positive returns regardless of volatility in a positive trendline environment.",
      "Bitcoin volatility appears to be on the decline. A recent Bloomberg analysis compared Bitcoin’s recent bull run to the 2017 boom — and found that volatility is considerably lower this time around. Why? The rise of institutional participants and the general stabilizing effect of crypto \"going mainstream.\"",
      "Whether Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency has a place in your investment portfolio depends on your personal circumstances, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. And even though Bitcoin has trended steadily upwards in over the past decade, it also has had substantial down cycles. Investors should be careful navigating volatile markets (and consider working with a financial advisor before making major investments).",
      "Myth #6: Bitcoin isn’t secure",
      " The Bitcoin network has never been hacked. ",
      "Its open-source code has been scrutinized by countless security experts and computer scientists.Bitcoin was also the first digital currency to solve the double-spend problem, making \"trustless\" peer-to-peer currencies a reality. Further, All Bitcoin transactions are irreversible.",
      "The real story: ",
      "Many misconceptions around the security of Bitcoin stem from attacks on third-party businesses and services that make use of Bitcoin, and not the Bitcoin network itself. High-profile hacks of early Bitcoin companies with flawed security procedures (like the one that hit the early Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox) and occasional data breaches (like the one that impacted users of the wallet provider Ledger) have made some users question the security of Bitcoin.",
      "Bitcoin’s core protocol has functioned securely with 99.9% uptime since its creation in 2009.",
      "A vast amount of computing power secures the network. And the miners that power the network are distributed throughout the world, with nodes in 100 countries —which means there are no single points of failure.",
      "Myth #7: Bitcoin is bad for the environment",
      "Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process. But determining the environmental impact is hard. For one thing, all aspects of the digital economy require energy. Consider the entire global banking system, and all of the energy required to process bank transactions and power office buildings, ATMs, local branches, and much more.",
      "The real story: ",
      "Recent research by New York-based fund Ark Investment Management concludes that \"Bitcoin is much more efficient than traditional banking and gold mining on a global scale.\"",
      "A significant portion of Bitcoin mining is powered by renewable-energy sources (including wind, hydro, and solar). The actual number ranges from 20 percent to more than 70 percent, according to Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.",
      "The Cambridge researchers concluded:\"Bitcoin’s environmental footprint currently remains marginal at best.\"",
      "An argument can even be made that the economic incentives inherent to Bitcoin mining are helping drive sustainable energy innovation, as miners constantly seek to increase profits by lowering their electricity costs — in a world where renewable energy is fast becoming the cheapest option.",

      "Expert tips: A former private equity manager who now funds DeFi tech",
      " We asked crypto influencers, veteran traders, and VC fund founders to share their top tips, essential research strategies, and more. In this article, we speak to ParaFi Capital managing partner Ben Forman. ",
      "Ben Forman is the managing partner of San Francisco-based ParaFi Capital, a fund that invests in blockchain technology and decentralized finance (or DeFi) markets. He founded ParaFi in 2018 after a decade of working in traditional finance — focusing on private equity and credit markets — at major firms like KKR and TPG. \"Outside of Bitcoin as a non-sovereign store of value, DeFi is the main area of the blockchain space that has real product-market fit, real users, and real traction,\" he says. \"Non-sovereign, uncensorable financial services is where we\'re focused.\"",
      "Take the long view",
      "Especially when it comes to Bitcoin, Forman recommends investing amounts you can afford without trying to time the market. \"Trying to predict where the prices will be in a week or a month just isn't a great use of energy, in my experience,\" he says. \"I've been investing in crypto since 2013, through multiple bull and bear cycles. I believe virtual assets have a place in everyone's portfolio — it's just a matter of how you want to size that exposure.”",
      "DeFi demystified",
      "DeFi allows for novel financial products like flash loans and quick, cheap, cross-border transfers of value. Forman believes DeFi’s big themes — faster, cheaper, greater accessibility— will help it to transform the financial industry.“All the '",
      " ing ",
      "verbs’ of finance are what we’re looking at,\" he says. \"Lending, borrowing, hedging, exchanging, indexing, robo-advising. In traditional capital markets, all those things have friction and middlemen extracting fees.\"",
      "Experience is the best teacher",
      "Some crypto concepts can be difficult to grasp in the abstract. Forman recommends putting aside small sums and trying a few DeFi apps for yourself, using a crypto wallet and browser such as Ai Earn Wallet, \"...just start using applications. When you swap between two tokens on [decentralized exchange] Uniswap, you get a feel for it. Or when you deposit stablecoins to [lending protocol] Compound and start earning a dollar-denominated yield without any kind of direct counterparty risk, that’s really interesting. That's when the lightbulb goes off.”",
      "Embrace the rabbit hole",
      "A huge amount of information is available to all crypto investors. Forman suggests visiting DeFi Pulse — a website which ranks protocols by the amount of capital that is \"locked\" into them at a given time — and clicking on interesting-sounding projects to see what they do. \"At any given time I have, like, 20 open browser tabs full of articles I need to read,\" he says. \"Each post leads to another post, which leads to another one — and you eventually end up on this journey of understanding.\"",
      "Dive into the data",
      "One of the advantages of DeFi (at least for tech-minded investors) is the transparency afforded by blockchain. \"You can look at applications and see, in real time, how many people are using them, how much they\'re using them,\" Forman says. \"So if it\'s a decentralized exchange, you can see how much volume is flowing through each day, and try to measure adoption and usage in real time.\"",
      "This story has just begun",
      "Forman sees huge opportunity for crypto to make finance cheaper and more accessible —or, as he puts it, \"an Amazon-like experience for money.\" He also notes that these tools won’t always require specialized knowledge to use. \"When you send an email, you don’t need to understand how SMTP works,\" he says. \"Or if you’re browsing a website, you’re not thinking about HTTP. It\'s all abstracted away. We’re entering a world where finance and capital markets will run through blockchains. But we\'re not going to have to ",

      "Diamond hands",
      "Or as Elon Musk put it in a May tweet: . Diamond hands is a meme popularized by crypto and stock traders on Reddit. It connotes a hardcore adherence to the HODL philosophy (see below) — and is often used by online groups that have banded together to try to drive up the price of a memecoin or other asset. (The related-but-derogatory term for skittish traders? \"Paper hands\"/. )",
      "FOMO",
      "Standsfor \"fear of missing out\" — and is generally most intense when markets are rising fast.

One popular option is dollar-cost averaging (or DCA),in which you invest the same amount every week or month without worrying about what the market is doing.",
      "FUD",
      "Stands for \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\" It’s a classic public relations and propaganda tactic. The idea is to warp public perception about a product, technology, or candidate by strategically releasing misinformation designed to create a negative emotional response.",
      "Mainframe-computer architect and entrepreneur Gene Amdahl is often credited with popularizing the term in the 1980s. He used it to describe the way IBM salespeople of the era worked to delegitimize competitors’ products, painting them as unreliable and untrustworthy.",

      "HODL",
      "HODL is probably the most prevalent piece of crypto slang. It originally came from a drunken typo in the subject line of a 2013 Bitcoin forum post:\"I AM HODLING\". (It should have read \"holding.\")",
      "HODL — usually pronounced \"hoddle\" — simply means to buy and hold for the long term, no matter what the market is doing. Bitcoin fans have even retroactively turned it into an acronym that stands for \"hold on for dear life.\"",
      "The original forum post is riddled with typos, but the underlying message was prescient. At the time, Bitcoin’s value had plummeted from $1242 to $480 in a month. Panicked traders were bailing out, but GameKyuuubi — real name Mike, a programmer — wasn’t selling:\"In a zero-sum game such as this,\" he wrote, \"traders can only take your money if you sell.\"",
      "The sentiment soon spread throughout the Bitcoin community and countless memes ensued.Crypto has experienced multiple bull and bear cycles, but so far at least, HODL has been good advice — with Bitcoin emerging as one of the best-performing assets of the last decade. (As mentioned in the FOMO entry above, one good way to HODL is via DCA.)",
      "Laser eyes",
      "In 2021, avid Bitcoin proponents began signalling their support for the cryptocurrency by adding \"laser eyes\" to their Twitter photo. NFL superstar Tom Brady, Paris Hilton, Elon Musk, Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis, and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor are a few of the famous names who have taken part. The meme is often associated with the hashtag #LaserRayUntil100K — indicating support for the cryptocurrency’s potential to break the $100,000 mark.",

But in 2021, when Dogecoin dramatically rose in value, a huge wave of other tokens with absurd names emerged (in part made possible by decentralized exchanges like Sushiswap, which allow anyone to easily list a token). In May 2021, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin donated more than $1 billion in DOGE-inspired memecoins like AKITA, SHIB, and Dogelon Mars (ELON) towards COVID-relief efforts in India and other causes.

Cryptocurrencies with smaller market caps are particularly vulnerable to pump and dump schemes. A group of traders will work together to drive up the price of a specific small-cap altcoin. As prices rise, the schemers will promote the opportunity on Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Facebook, YouTube comments, and elsewhere, attracting more investors and driving the price up further.

      "Even if you had access to every bit of information available, a sudden black swan event, hack, or tweet from a high-profile individual could cause prices to plummet. This is why it’s crucial to plan ahead and to take steps to mitigate your losses should some kind of sudden crash occur.",
      "Investors could consider fixed strategies like dollar-cost averaging (the process of buying or selling small amounts over regular intervals), which could help a crypto buyer completely avoid trading with their emotions, or having to stare at the charts 24/7.",
      " Remember: ",
      "It’s very easy to get carried away while holding volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Trading can be a very high-risk activity, and especially in a bear market, and investors should aim to set goals that balance minimizing potential losses with achieving potential gains.",
      "#3 - HODLing and long-term thinking",
      "While the saying that \"it’s not a loss until you sell\" is only partially true, it does carry some weight. If the value of your assets has gone down since you bought them — called unrealized losses — they are only realized once they’re sold for less than your purchase price.",
      "Through the years, Bitcoin has consistently trended upwards over the long term. Even if prices are falling due to a temporary market correction or a longer bear market, history shows that prices are likely to recover eventually due to economic drivers like scarcity. Many people believe that this limited availability will cause the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to continue to rise over time. If your investing timeframe is on the longer side (years instead of weeks or months) negative price movement can be viewed as being temporary.",

      "#4 - Be ready to ride out the dip or take profits",
      "One of the safest options for avoiding crypto volatility and protecting yourself during a market dip is to convert some of your volatile crypto holdings for more stable assets. This can help an investor ‘lock-in’ their balance and reduce their risk and need to actively manage their portfolio and stress levels in a cryptocurrency bull market.",
      "Stablecoins like USDC aim to maintain their value at a fixed price — and by converting part of your portfolio into stable-value assets, you lower your exposure to price changes while the markets are in a lull.",
      "But also remember that selling everything at once, called capitulation, can easily cause crypto holders to lose out if the market suddenly rebounds. This is why it is so important to map out an idea of what level of profit and loss you would be comfortable with before you’re forced to make decisions under pressure.",
      " Remember: ",
      "Many investors today choose to move in and out of stable assets as part of a larger withdrawal and buy-back strategy, which can help gradually grow their portfolios if the timing is right. This isn’t easy though, and even the most experienced investors often fail to time their entries and exits correctly. (Again, for many investors, dollar-cost averaging can be a good way to avoid even attempting to time the market.)",
      "#5 - See the opportunities",
      "Even when the crypto markets are falling, there are opportunities if you know where to look. Where others see a dark and cold crypto winter, keen investors see a new window of opportunity to get their favorite assets at a discount and turn a profit.",
      "\"Buying the dip\" is a popular way for traders who felt priced out of previous gains to get into the market or increase their positions.",
      "Even within a downtrend, there will still be small peaks and valleys as the market fluctuates. Traders that have brushed up on their technical analysis skills can stand to benefit here, using that knowledge to predict these short-term movements and capitalize on them by buying the short-term lows and selling the highs.",
      "Short selling, or betting that an asset’s value will fall, can also be a good strategy to turn a profit during dips.",
      "Activities like staking and DeFi yield farming can further help level out returns and provide support to make sure your actual crypto balance is always growing, even in a bear market or downtrend.",
      "If you believe an asset will eventually be worth more, dollar-cost averaging works whether markets are up or down! In fact, you get more crypto for your dollar during down cycles.",
      " Remember: ",

They’re called blockchains because they’re literally made up of blocks of data – picture a really long train – that can be traced all the way back to the first-ever transaction on the network. And because they are open source, they rely on their communities to maintain and develop their underlying code.",
      "A fork happens whenever a community makes a change to the blockchain’s protocol, or basic set of rules. When this happens, the chain splits — producing a second blockchain that shares all of its history with the original, but is headed off in a new direction.",
      "Why is this important?",
      "Most digital currencies have independent development teams responsible for changes and improvements to the network, much in the same way that changes to internet protocols allow web browsing to become better over time. So sometimes a fork happens to make a cryptocurrency more secure or add other features.",

      "Think of a soft fork as a software upgrade for the blockchain. As long as it’s adopted by all users, it becomes a currency’s new set of standards. Soft forks have been used to bring new features or functions, typically at the programming level, to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Because the end result is a single blockchain, the changes are backward-compatible with the pre-fork blocks.",
      " Hard fork: ",
      "A hard fork happens when the code changes so much the new version is no longer backward-compatible with earlier blocks. In this scenario, the blockchain splits in two: the original blockchain and new version that follows the new set of rules. This creates an entirely new cryptocurrency – and is the source of many well-known coins. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold evolved out of the original Bitcoin blockchain via hard fork.",

      "An older fork might continue as a stable, well-proven platform while a newer fork might offer developers entirely novel ways of interacting with it. (Older and newer versions can eventually merge or continue evolving further apart.)",

      "What marks the end of a bull market?",
      "Even during a bull market there will be fluctuations, dips, and corrections along the way. It can be easy to misinterpret short-term downward movements as the end of a bull market. This is why it’s important to consider any potential signs for a trend reversal from a broader perspective, looking at price action over longer time frames. (Investors with a shorter time-frame often talk about \"buying the dip.\")",
      "History has shown that bull markets don’t last forever, and at some point, investor confidence will begin to decline — this could be triggered by anything from bad news like unfavorable legislation to unforeseen circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic. A sharp downwards price movement can begin a bear market, where more and more investors believe prices will continue to fall, causing a downward spiral as they sell in order to prevent further losses.",
      "What is a bear market?",
      " Bear markets ",
      "are defined as a period of time where supply is greater than demand, confidence is low, and prices are falling. Pessimistic investors who believe prices will continue to fall are, therefore, referred to as \"bears.\" Bear markets can be difficult to trade in — particularly for inexperienced traders.",
      "It’s notoriously difficult to predict when the bear market might end and when the bottom price has been reached — as rebounding is usually a slow and unpredictable process that can be influenced by many external factors such as economic growth, investor psychology, and world news or events.",
      "But they also can present opportunities. After all, if your investment strategy is longer-term, buying during a bear market can pay off when the cycle reverses itself. Investors with shorter-term strategies can also be on the lookout for temporary price spikes or corrections. And for more advanced investors, there are strategies like short selling, which is a way of betting that an asset will decline in price.Another strategy many crypto investors employ is dollar-cost averaging, in which you’d invest a set amount of money (say $50) every week or month, whether the asset is rising or falling. This distributes your risk and allows you to invest through bull and bear markets alike.",

If you assume DeFi will grow, you might guess that Ethereum’s value will increase in the future.",
      "How does technical analysis work?",
      "Technical analysis is more of a numbers-driven approach to decision-making. It assumes that the market has already done the work of incorporating all the known information via the current price (which you can find in the Ai Earn app or many other places online) and amount of trading activity (look to crypto-data sites like Nomics and CoinGecko).",
      "Because current prices reflect market forces like supply and demand, practitioners of technical analysis believe that the price of an asset should give you a snapshot of how the public feels about it right now. This is known as market sentiment, and it’s an indicator traders use to predict trends and make investment decisions.",

      "Professional traders, on the other hand, might rely much more on one or other. (Large, mature markets tend to have lots of traders of both types.) A trader might, for instance, perform technical analysis using computer models that deeply examine changes in price and volume – including regressions, the relative strength index, and stock-market data.

You can use losses to offset other capital gains (including from non-crypto assets, like stocks) you may have had during the year on a dollar-for-dollar basis, potentially reducing your overall tax bill.",
      "If you have more losses than gains or have no gains at all, the maximum amount of losses that you can declare each year to offset other income is $3,000. Any remainder carries over to subsequent years until the full amount of the loss is applied.",

This report is designed to help taxpayers quickly and easily understand their gains or losses for the tax year, using our calculations. The report will only have information about activity on Ai Earn. It won’t have information about crypto-related transactions outside of Ai Earn.

      "The \"crypto\" in the word \"cryptocurrency\" means \"secret\" in Greek – which gives you a clue as to what the field of cryptography is all about. Cryptography is the study and practice of sending secure, encrypted messages or data between two or more parties. The sender \"encrypts\" the message, which obscures its content to a third party, and the receiver \"decrypts\" the message, making it legible again.",
      "Cryptocurrencies use cryptography to allow transactions to be anonymous, secure, and \"trustless,\" which means you don’t need to know anything about a person to safely make transactions with them – and you don’t need bank, credit-card company, government, or any other third party in the middle. And cryptography isn’t just important for digital money — our computer and the networks it’s attached to are encrypting and decrypting data constantly, from every Google search you make to every email you send.",
      "Why is cryptography important?",
      "Cryptocurrencies are entirely based on cryptographic ideas. Bitcoin was invented by a pseudonymous person (or group of people) going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who proposed the idea in the form of a whitepaper posted to a cryptography message board in 2009.",
      "The thorniest issue that Nakamoto solved was something called the double-spend problem. Because Bitcoin is just code, what’s to stop a person from making and spending multiple copies of their money? Nakamoto’s solution was based on a well-known encryption arrangement known as public-private key encryption.",
      "Bitcoin (as well as Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies) uses a technology called public-private key encryption. This allows them to be \"trustless\" – and makes secure transactions between strangers possible without a \"trusted intermediary\" like a bank or Paypal in the middle.",
      "How does public-private key encryption work?",
      "The Bitcoin network issues all users a private key (essentially a really strong password) from which it cryptographically generates a linked public key. You can freely give people your public key – in fact, that’s the only piece of information anyone needs to send you Bitcoin. But to access those funds, the private key is required.",
      "Part of what makes Bitcoin revolutionary is its solution for the double-spend problem:A peer-to-peer network that uses cryptographic methods to verify the authenticity of transactions.",
      "Your public key is generated from your private key via a method called \"hashing\" – which is taking a string of data and processing it through an algorithm. It’s virtually impossible to reverse this process, so nobody can guess your private key from your public key.",
      "Because your public and private keys are linked, the network knows that your bitcoin belong to you – and will remain yours as long as you have your private key.",
      "Another impact of not having an intermediary is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible(after all, there is no credit-card company to call if you make a mistake). But this is a feature, not a bug: permanent transactions are a key part of the solution to the double spend problem.",

The technology that powers digital currencies also has wide-ranging potential beyond the financial industry, from revolutionizing supply chains to building the new, decentralized internet.",
      "How does cryptocurrency work?",
      "Bitcoin is the first and most well-known, but there are thousands of types of cryptocurrencies. Many, like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, share Bitcoin’s core characteristics but explore new ways to process transactions. Others offer a wider range of features. Ethereum, for example, can be used to run applications and create contracts. All four, however, are based on an idea called the blockchain, which is",
      " key to understanding how cryptocurrency works. ",
      "At its most basic, a blockchain is a list of transactions that anyone can view and verify.",
      " The Bitcoin blockchain, for example, is a record of every time someone sends or receives bitcoin ",
      ". This list of transactions is fundamental for most cryptocurrencies because it enables secure payments to be made between people who don’t know each other without having to go through a third-party verifier like a bank.",

An associated public key can be freely and safely shared with others to receive value on the network. From the public key, it is impossible for anyone to guess your private key.",
      "What is cryptocurrency mining?",
      "Most cryptocurrencies are ‘mined’ via a decentralized (also known as peer-to-peer) network of computers.

      "Technically,",
      " anyone with a computer and an internet connection can become a miner ",
      ". But before you get excited, it’s worth noting that mining is not always profitable. Depending on which cryptocurrency you’re mining, how fast your computer is, and the cost of electricity in your area, you may end up spending more on mining than you earn back in cryptocurrency.",
      "As a result, most crypto mining these days is done by companies that specialize in it, or by large groups of individuals who all contribute their computing power.",
      " How does the network encourage miners to participate in maintaining the blockchain? ",

      "by a person or group going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "This paper wasn’t the first idea for digital money drawing on the fields of cryptography and computer science—in fact, the paper referred to earlier concepts—but",
      " it was a uniquely elegant solution to the problem of establishing trust between different online entities ",
      ", where people may be hidden (like bitcoin’s own creator) by pseudonyms, or physically located on the other side of the planet.",
      " Nakamoto devised a pair of intertwined concepts ",
      ": the bitcoin private key and the blockchain ledger. When you hold bitcoin, you control it through a private key—a string of randomized numbers and letters that unlocks a virtual vault containing your purchase. Each private key is tracked on the virtual ledger called the blockchain.",
      " When Bitcoin first appeared, it marked a major advance in computer science ",
      ", because it solved a fundamental problem of commerce on the internet: how do you transfer value between two people without a trusted intermediary (like a bank) in the middle? By solving that problem, the invention of bitcoin has wide-ranging ramifications: As a currency designed for the internet, it allows for financial transactions that range across borders and around the globe without the involvement of banks, credit-card companies, lenders, or even governments. When any two people—wherever they might live—can send payments to each other without encountering those gatekeepers, it creates the potential for an open financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative. That, in a nutshell, is bitcoin explained.",
      " Bitcoin creates the potential for an open financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative. ",
      "How Bitcoin works",
      "Unlike credit card networks like Visa and payment processors like Paypal, bitcoin is not owned by an individual or company. Bitcoin is the world’s first completely open payment network which anyone with an internet connection can participate in. Bitcoin was designed to be used on the internet, and doesn’t depend on banks or private companies to process transactions.",
      "One of the most important elements of Bitcoin is the blockchain, which tracks who owns what, similar to how a bank tracks assets. What sets the Bitcoin blockchain apart from a bank's ledger is that it is decentralized, meaning anyone can view it and no single entity controls it.",
      "Here are some details about how it all works: ",
      " Specialized computers known as ‘mining rigs’ perform the equations required to verify and record a new transaction. ",
      "In the early days, a typical desktop PC was powerful enough to participate, which allowed pretty much anyone who was curious to try their hand at mining. These days the computers required are massive, specialized, and often owned by businesses or large numbers of individuals pooling their resources. (In October 2019, it required 12 trillion times more computing power to mine one bitcoin than it did when Nakamoto mined the first blocks in January 2009.)",
      " The miners’ collective computing power is used to ensure the accuracy of the ever-growing ledger. ",
      "Bitcoin is inextricably tied to the blockchain; each new bitcoin is recorded on it, as is each subsequent transaction with all existing coins.",
      " How does the network motivate miners to participate in the constant, essential work of maintaining the blockchain—verifying transactions? ",
      "The Bitcoin network holds a continuous lottery in which all the mining rigs around the world race to be the first to solve a math problem. Every 10 min or so, a winner is found, and the winner updates the Bitcoin ledger with new valid transactions. The prize changes over time, but as of early 2020, each winner of this raffle was awarded 12.5 bitcoin.",
      "At the beginning, a bitcoin was technically worthless. As of the end of 2019, it was trading at around $7,500.",
      " As bitcoin’s value has risen, its easy divisibility (the ability to buy a small fraction of one bitcoin) has become a key attribute. ",
      "One bitcoin is currently divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin); the bitcoin community refers to the smallest unit as a ‘Satoshi.’",
      " Nakamoto set the network up so that the number of bitcoin will never exceed 21 million, ensuring scarcity ",
      ". There are currently around 3 million bitcoin still available to be mined, which will happen more and more slowly. The last blocks will theoretically be mined in 2140.",
      "Cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies share some traits — like how you can use them to buy things or how you can transfer them electronically — but they’re also different in interesting ways. Here are a few highlights.",
      " Bitcoin is the world’s first completely open payment network which anyone with an internet connection can participate in. ",
      " Key question ",
      " How does bitcoin have value? ",
      "Essentially the same way a traditional currency does – because it’s proven itself to be a viable and convenient way to store value, which means it can easily be traded for goods, services, or other assets. It’s scarce, secure, portable (compared to, say, gold), and easily divisible, allowing transactions of all sizes.",
      "How to get Bitcoin",
      "The easiest way to buy bitcoin is to purchase it through an online exchange like Ai Earn. Ai Earn makes it easy to buy, sell, send, receive, and store bitcoin without needing to hold it yourself using something called public and private keys.",
      "How to buy bitcoin, with Ai Earn CEO Brian Armstrong",
      "However, if you choose to buy and store bitcoin outside of an online exchange, here’s how that works.",
      "Bitcoin is inextricably tied to the blockchain; each new bitcoin is recorded on it, as is each subsequent transaction with all existing coins.",
      "When you buy bitcoin—or send/receive it—you get a public key, which you can think of as a key that unlocks a virtual vault and gives you access to your money.",
      "Anyone can send bitcoin to you via your public key, but only the holder of the private key can access the bitcoin in the \"virtual vault\" once it’s been sent.",
      "There are many ways to store bitcoin both online and off. ",
      " The simplest solution is a virtual wallet ",
      "If you want to transfer money from your wallet to a bank account after selling your bitcoin, ",
      " the Ai Earn app makes it as easy as transferring funds from one bank to another ",
      ". Similar to conventional bank transfers or ATM withdrawals, exchanges like Ai Earn set a daily limit, and it may take between a few days and a week for the transaction to be completed.",
      " The easiest way to buy bitcoin is to purchase it through an online exchange like Ai Earn. ",
      " Key question ",
      " What’s the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain? ",
      "All bitcoin transactions and public keys are recorded on a virtual ledger called the blockchain. The ledger is effectively a chronological list of transactions. This ledger is copied—exactly—across every computer that is connected to the bitcoin network, and it is constantly checked and secured using a vast amount of computing power across the globe. The blockchain concept has turned out to be powerful and adaptable, and there are now a wide variety of non-cryptocurrency-related blockchains that are used for things like supply-chain management. The ‘Bitcoin Blockchain’ specifically refers to the virtual ledger that records bitcoin transactions and private keys.",
      "How to use Bitcoin",
      "Back in 2013, a bitcoin enthusiast named Laszlo Hanyecz created a message-board post offering 10,000 BTC – which then was worth around $25 – to anyone who would deliver two pizzas to his Jacksonville, Florida, home. As the legend goes, those two pizzas, which another bitcoin early-adopter bought from a local Papa John’s, marked the first successful purchase of non-virtual goods using bitcoin. Thankfully it’s a lot easier to use bitcoin these days!",
      " It’s simple ",
      ": Transactions using BTC aren’t that different from those using a credit or debit card, but instead of being asked to enter card info, you’ll simply be entering the payment amount and the vendor’s public key (similar to an email address) via a wallet app. (When transacting in person using smartphones or tablets, often a QR code will pop up to simplify the process – when you scan the code, your wallet app will automatically enter the pertinent information.)",
      " It’s private ",
      ": One of the benefits of paying with bitcoin is that doing so limits the amount of personal information you need to provide. The only time you need to share your name and address is if you’re purchasing physical goods that need to be shipped.",
      " It’s flexible ",
      ": As to what you should do with your bitcoin, that depends completely on your personal interests. Here are some ideas: ",
      "You can sell it for cash using an exchange or a Bitcoin ATM.",
      "You can spend it online or in brick-and-mortar retailers as you would any other currency by using a Bitcoin debit card.",
      "You can hold on to some or all of it as part of your investment and savings strategy.",
      "You might choose to that is close to your heart (check out).",
      "And if you have a serious budget and unfulfilled astronaut dreams? Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic happily accepts BTC in exchange for the opportunity to blast off on one of its forthcoming space-tourism missions.",
      " Due to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions. ",
      "What makes Bitcoin a new kind of money?",
      " Bitcoin is global ",
      ". You can send it across the planet as easily as you can pay with cash in the physical world. It isn't closed on weekends, doesn’t charge you a fee to access your money, and doesn't impose any arbitrary limits.",
      " Bitcoin is irreversible ",
      ". Bitcoin is like cash, in the sense that transactions cannot be reversed by the sender. In comparison, credit cards, conventional online payment systems, and banking transactions can be reversed after the payment has been made—sometimes months after the initial transaction—due to the centralized intermediaries that complete the transactions. This creates higher fraud risk for merchants, which can lead to higher fees for using credit cards.",
      " Bitcoin is private ",
      ". When paying with bitcoin, there are no bank statements, or any need to provide unnecessary personal information to the merchant. Bitcoin transactions don’t contain any identifying information other than the bitcoin addresses and amounts involved.",
      " Bitcoin is secure ",
      ". Due to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions. When making a bitcoin payment, no sensitive information is required to be sent over the internet. There is a very low risk of your financial information being compromised, or having your identity stolen.",
      " Bitcoin is open ",
      ". Every transaction on the Bitcoin network is published publicly, without exception. This means there's no room for manipulation of transactions (save for a highly unlikely 51% attack scenario) or changing the supply of bitcoin. The software that constitutes the core of Bitcoin is free and open-source so anyone can review the code.",
      " Bitcoin is safe ",
      ". In more than ten years of existence, the bitcoin network has never been successfully hacked. And because the system is permissionless and open-sourced, countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the network and its security.",

Via a Lightning Network-compatible payments app called Strike, many of Twitter’s 360 million monthly active users can send Bitcoin payments to other Twitter accounts instantly and for free.

      "The Lightning Network was invented, in part, to help Bitcoin function more like the digital cash that Nakamoto envisioned. It processes transactions \"off-chain\" much more quickly and cheaply than Bitcoin’s core blockchain — with fees that are typically fractions of a cent. Lightning transactions are also less energy intensive than transactions on the main blockchain.",
      "While the main Bitcoin blockchain (layer 1) can typically handle fewer than 10 transactions per second, the Lightning Network (layer 2) can theoretically handle millions of transactions a second.",
      "How does the Lightning Network work?",
      "The Lightning Network uses smart contracts to establish off-blockchain payment channels between pairs of users. Once these payment channels are established, funds can be transferred between them almost instantly.",
      "Cleverly, the network doesn’t need to create pairs between all users. For instance, if User A has a channel with User B, and User C has a channel with User B butnotUser A, funds can still be freely transferred between all networked parties. Lightning addresses look like typical Bitcoin addresses, and the payment process is very similar for users.",
      "At any time, users can close their payment channels and settle their final balances on the core blockchain.",
      "Because only the opening and closing of payment channels are recorded on the core blockchain, the entire Bitcoin network can move faster.

The ICP token is used for governance (holders can vote on the future of the network), to reward network participants for good behavior, and is used to pay fees for making transactions.",
      "Like a lot of projects in the cryptocurrency space, the Internet Computer Protocol (or ICP) is much more than a form of digital money. In fact, the ICP token that can be purchased and traded via exchanges like Ai Earn is just one part of a much bigger idea.",
      "ICP’s basic idea is to create a new kind of decentralized internet and global computing system — where independent data centers all over the world could join together to create an alternative to the cloud services (from companies like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud) that power most of the current internet. ICP’s plan is to have the protocol running on millions of computers around the world.",
      "ICP developers say the resulting network has some key advantages over the centralized alternatives. For one, it operates via open standards and avoids the conflicts of interest that can arise when a major cloud-computing provider hosts products that compete with its own services.",
      "Originally called DFINITY, ICP’s global and distributed network of data centers can run all of the applications that are accessible via traditional Internet standards such as DNS (the domain name system you use via web browsers and smartphones).",

      "How does ICP work?",
      "The Internet today is highly centralized. Popular applications on the web are often closed-source, proprietary, and are hosted on a handful of data centers owned by big tech firms. And if one critical data center fails, huge swathes of the web can also shut down with it. Another major concern (particularly for privacy advocates) is that centralized, corporate web-services providers have the ability to censor or deplatform applications.",
      "The Internet Computer attempts to offer a fundamental alternative so that developers can build, host, and serve applications in a more decentralized way— allowing websites to be deployed directly onto the public internet. Further, the Internet Computer would incentivize open source and transparent software development.",

      "One way you can think of ICP is as a way of converting crypto into processing power — the network will establish a fee based on the amount of computing power required by a developer’s project. As long as the fee is paid, the website will run on the public internet.",
      "In theory, any kind of application can be created and run on the Internet Computer — from social networks similar to LinkedIn and TikTok to software similar to all the familiar applications you know today to new kinds of applications not yet conceived. As a demonstration, ICP developers have published open source code for CanCan, which they describe as a \"decentralized TikTok.\"",
      "What risks might the Internet Computer face?",
      "Participating in the Internet Computer may require more robust hardware than traditional blockchain projects, potentially threatening its ethos of decentralization by limiting the number of potential participants. If the hardware requirements are too large, only large and well-capitalized players would be able to set up data centers and participate.",

Because most economists believe that some level of inflation is good for the economy, the U.S. government, for instance, has printed more money than consumers actually need for decades. It’s the reason that a Coke that cost a nickel a half-century ago goes for a few dollars today.",
      "Bitcoin, on the other hand, has generally increased in value much faster than the U.S. dollar has lost value — going from virtually worthless in 2010 to more than $20,000 in late 2020. (Because it’s a volatile market, Bitcoin has also seen dramatic spikes and declines, but the trendline over time has been upward.) This has made Bitcoin an increasingly popular hedge against fiat-currency inflation.",
      "The main way Bitcoin is designed to resist inflation is that its supply is limited and known, and the creation of new bitcoin will taper off over time in a predictable way. (There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, and every four years the amount of bitcoin that is mined is reduced by half.)",
      "Why is inflation important for crypto?",
      "A high inflation rate for fiat currencies might lead individuals to invest more in digital money because the dollars or Euros they placed in a savings account are actually losing value over time. Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum offer investors an alternative. The economics of the Bitcoin market are complex, but there are some features designed into the digital currency that may help it to resist inflation.",
      "Bitcoin can’t be manipulated by governments adjusting interest rates or printing more money to achieve policy goals.",
      "Like gold and other scarce stores of value, the conventional wisdom around Bitcoin is that it should rise in price in uncertain times. (This has not always been the case, however — at the start of the COVID pandemic for instance, it fell sharply along with the stock market.) It’s also a much more convenient way to store and transmit value than gold — it can simply be sent over the internet.",
      "Scarcity is one key to making a store of value resistant to inflation. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. As of now, approximately 19 million bitcoin have been mined. Around every ten minutes, miners process a new \"block\" and 6.25 bitcoin are added to the network. (In 2024, the mining reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoin, and will decline by half again every four years until all bitcoin are mined. This mechanism, which is designed into the Bitcoin protocol, is known as the halving.)",
      "This scheduled tapering of new supply over time makes Bitcoin predictable in unique ways — unlike gold, no new bitcoin can ever be \"discovered.\"",
      "Do cryptocurrencies experience inflation?",
      "Yes, technically even Bitcoin experiences inflation as more of it is mined (as does gold). But because the amount of new bitcoin is automatically reduced by 50 percent every four years, Bitcoin’s inflation rate will also decrease.",
      "As a practical matter, as long as Bitcoin’s purchasing power continues to rise vs. thefiat currencies we tend to compare it to, Bitcoin’s few-percent annual rate of inflation isn’t a major factor for investors to consider.",
      "But not all cryptocurrencies are designed like Bitcoin. For instance, an increasingly popular category of digital money called stablecoins — many of which are pegged to fiat currencies like the dollar — can be a useful, low-volatility place to save some money. But if a stablecoin is pegged to a fiat currency, your investment will be impacted by inflation and could lose value over time as their reserve currency loses value. (Some stablecoins offer rewards that function much like an interest-bearing savings account, which could change the value equation — especially with non-crypto interest rates hovering around zero.).",

It’s important to do research on any decentralized app you plan to use.",
      "The Ethereum protocol is currently being updated in ways that are intended to make it faster and even more secure. See the Ethereum 2.0 section below for more.",
      "How does Ethereum work?",
      "You might have heard that the Bitcoin blockchain is a lot like a bank’s ledger, or even a checkbook. It’s a running tally of every transaction made on the network going back to the very beginning — and all the computers on the network contribute their computing power towards the work of ensuring that the tally is accurate and secure.",
      "The Ethereum blockchain, on the other hand, is more like a computer: while it also does the work of documenting and securing transactions, it’s much more flexible than the Bitcoin blockchain. Developers can use the Ethereum blockchain to build a huge variety of tools — everything from logistics management software to games to the entire universe of DeFi applications (which span lending, borrowing, trading, and more).",
      "Ethereum uses a 'virtual machine' to achieve all this, which is like a giant, global computer made up of many individual computers running the Ethereum software. Keeping all of those computers running involves investment in both hardware and electricity by participants. To cover those costs, the network uses its own Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency called Ether (or, more commonly, ETH).",

      "Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can experience daily (or even hourly) price volatility. As with any kind of investment, volatility may cause uncertainty, fear of missing out, or fear of participating at all. When prices are fluctuating, how do you know when to buy?",
      "In an ideal world, it’s simple: buy low, sell high. In reality, this is easier said than done, even for experts. Instead of trying to \"time the market,\" many investors use a strategy called",

      "DCA might be the right choice when someone believes their investments will appreciate (or increase in value) in the long term and experience price volatility on the way there.",
      "What is DCA?",
      "DCA is a long-term strategy, where an investor regularly buys smaller amounts of an asset over a period of time, no matter the price (for example, investing $100 in Bitcoin every month for a year, instead of $1,200 at once). Their DCA schedule may change over time and — depending on their goals — it can last just a few months or many years.",
      "Although DCA is a popular way to buy Bitcoin, it isn’t unique to crypto — traditional investors have been using this strategy for decades to weather stock market volatility. You may even use DCA already if you invest via your employer’s retirement plan every payday.",
      "What are the benefits of DCA?",
      "DCA can be an effective way to own crypto without the notoriously difficult work of timing the market or the risk of unwittingly using all of your funds to invest \"a lump sum\" at a peak.",
      "The key is choosing an amount that’s affordable and investing regularly, no matter the price of an asset. This has the potential to \"average\" out the cost of purchases over time and reduce the overall impact of a sudden drop in prices on any given purchase. And if prices do fall, DCA investors can continue to buy, as scheduled, with the potential to earn returns as prices recover.",
      "When is DCA more effective than lump-sum investing?",
      "DCA can help an investor safely enter a market, start benefiting from long-term price appreciation, and average out the risk of downward price movements in the short-term. And in situations like the ones below, it may offer more predictable returns than investing a lot of cash at once: ",

      "If an investor thinks prices are about to go down — but are likely to recover in the long term — they can use DCA to invest cash over the period of time they think a downward movement will happen.

      " Hedging bets through volatility. ",

      " Avoiding FOMO and emotional trading. ",
      "DCA is a rule-based approach to investing. Often, beginner traders fall into the trap of \"emotional trading\", where buying and selling decisions are dictated by psychological factors like fear or excitement.

If you invested $100 in bitcoin every week starting on December 18, 2017 (near that year’s price peak), you would have invested a total of $16,300.

Stocks are considered to have a wide range of volatility, from the relative stability of large-cap stocks (like Apple or Berkshire Hathaway) to often erratic \"penny stocks.\" Bonds, by contrast, are considered to be a lower-volatility asset — and typically see less dramatic upward and downward swings that take place over longer time frames.",

      " When people talk about measuring volatility, they’re usually referring to \"historical volatility,\" a number derived from a study of prices over a specific time period (often 30 days or a year). ",
      "The prediction of future movements is called \"implied volatility\" — and because nobody can actually predict the future it’s a less exact science (although it’s the basis for widely used financial tools like the Cboe Volatility Index, nicknamed the \"fear index,\" which predicts the next 30 days’ stock market volatility). Quantifying volatility can be done a couple of ways: ",
      "You can use a method called beta, which measures how volatile one stock is relative to the broader market (the typical benchmark is the S&P 500).",

      "Traditionally, retail investors are advised to diversify their investments within an asset class as a way of reducing risk. One popular strategy is to invest in a basket of stocks (or an index fund), rather than just a few.

That said, higher trading volumes on Bitcoin (by far the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap) and increased institutional participation seem to be reducing its volatility over time. Cryptocurrencies with lower trading volumes or emerging cryptoassets like DeFi tokens tend to have higher volatility — when experimenting with these assets as a beginner it’s best to risk amounts you can afford to lose.",
      "Factors that can increase volatility include positive or negative news coverage and earnings reports that are better or worse than expected. Unusually high spikes in volume of trading will usually correspond to volatility. Very low volume (as seen with so-called penny stocks that don’t trade on major markets or smaller cryptocurrencies) also usually corresponds with high volatility.",

      "The reason your crypto earns rewards while staked is because the blockchain puts it to work. Cryptocurrencies that allow staking use a \"consensus mechanism\" called Proof of Stake, which is the way they ensure that all transactions are verified and secured without a bank or payment processor in the middle. Your crypto, if you choose to stake it, becomes part of that process.",
      "Why do only some cryptocurrencies have staking?",
      "This is where it starts to get more technical. Bitcoin, for instance, doesn’t allow staking. To understand why, you need a little bit of background.",

So how do all the computers in a decentralized network arrive at the correct answer without having it fed to them by a central authority like a bank or a credit-card company? They use a \"consensus mechanism.\"",
      "Many cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 — use a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work. Via Proof of Work, the network throws a huge amount of processing power at solving problems like validating transactions between strangers on opposite sides of the planet and making sure nobody is trying to spend the same money twice. Part of the process involves \"miners\" all over the world competing to be the first to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The winner earns the right to add the latest \"block\" of verified transactions onto the blockchain — and receives some crypto in return.",
      "For a relatively simple blockchain like Bitcoin’s (which functions a lot like a bank’s ledger, tracking incoming and outgoing transactions) Proof of Work is a scalable solution. But for something more complex like Ethereum — which has a huge variety of applications including the whole world of DeFi running on top of the blockchain — Proof of Work can cause bottlenecks when there’s too much activity. As a result transaction times can be longer and fees can be higher.",
      "What is Proof of Stake?",
      "A newer consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake has emerged — with the idea of increasing speed and efficiency while lowering fees. A major way Proof of Stake reduces costs is by not requiring all those miners to churn through math problems, which is an energy-intensive process. Instead, transactions are validated by people who are literally invested in the blockchain via staking.",
      "Staking serves a similar function to mining, in that it’s the process by which a network participant gets selected to add the latest batch of transactions to the blockchain and earn some crypto in exchange.",
      "The exact implementations vary from project to project, but in essence, users put their tokens on the line for a chance to add a new block onto the blockchain in exchange for a reward. Their staked tokens act as a guarantee of the legitimacy of any new transaction they add to the blockchain.",
      "The network chooses validators (as they’re usually known) based on the size of their stake and the length of time they’ve held it. So the most invested participants are rewarded. If transactions in a new block are discovered to be invalid, users can have a certain amount of their stake burned by the network, in what is known as a slashing event.",
      "What are the advantages of staking?",
      "Many long-term crypto holders look at staking as a way of making their assets work for them by generating rewards, rather than collecting dust in their crypto wallets.",
      "Staking has the added benefit of contributing to the security and efficiency of the blockchain projects you support. By staking some of your funds, you make the blockchain more resistant to attacks and strengthen its ability to process transactions.",
      "What are some staking risks?",
      "Staking often requires a lockup or \"vesting\" period, where your crypto can’t be transferred for a certain period of time. This can be a drawback, as you won’t be able to trade staked tokens during this period even if prices shift. Before staking, it is important to research the specific staking requirements and rules for each project you are looking to get involved with.",

That said, becoming a full validator can require a minimum investment, technical knowledge, and a dedicated computer that can perform validations day or night without downtime.

      "The exact details vary by project, but in general proof of stake blockchains employ a network of \"validators\" who contribute — or \"stake\" — theirown crypto in exchange for a chance of getting to validate new transaction, update the blockchain, and earn a reward.",
      "The network selects a winner based on the amount of crypto each validator has in the pool and the length of time they’ve had it there — literally rewarding the most invested participants.",
      "Once the winner has validated the latest block of transactions, other validators can attest that the block is accurate. When a threshold number of attestations have been made, the network updates the blockchain.",
      "All participating validators receive a reward in the native cryptocurrency, which is generally distributed by the network in proportion to each validator’s stake.",
      "Becoming a validator is a major responsibility and requires a fairly high level of technical knowledge. The minimum amount of crypto that validators are required to stake is often relatively high (for ETH2, for example, it’s 32 ETH) and validators can lose some of their stake via a process called slashing if their node goes offline or if they validate a \"bad\" block of transactions.",
      "But even if that sounds like too much responsibility, you can still participate in staking by joining a staking pool run by someone else — and earn rewards for crypto that would otherwise be sitting around. This process is often referred to as delegating, and tools offered by exchanges by Ai Earn can make it simple and seamless.",
      "What are some differences between proof of work and proof of stake?",
      "Energy consumption is one major difference between the two consensus mechanisms. Because proof-of-stake blockchains don’t require miners to spend electricity on duplicative processes (competing to solve the same puzzle), proof of stake allows networks to operate with substantially lower resource consumption.",
      "Both consensus mechanisms have economic consequences that penalize network disruptions and thwart malicious actors. In proof of work, the penalty for miners submitting invalid information, or blocks, is the sunk cost of computing power, energy, and time. In proof of stake, the validators’ staked crypto funds serve as an economic incentive to act in the network’s best interests. In the case that a validator accepts a bad block, a portion of their staked funds will be \"slashed\" as a penalty. The amount that a validator can be slashed depends on the network.",

      "The Ethereum blockchain is home to a vast range of economic activity — from NFT markets and games to the growing DeFi ecosystem. Ethereum is well suited to this activity because it’s compatible with smart contracts, which can be used to build a vast range of applications.",
      "However, the growing popularity of these applications adds many transactions to the Ethereum blockchain — and as a result, transaction fees (also known as \"gas\") can sometimes rise to the point where making small or frequent investments can be economically unviable.",
      "Enter Polygon, which is a \"Layer 2\" scaling solution (or \"sidechain\") that’s emerged to provide faster transactions and lower costs for users. It acts as a speedy parallel blockchain running alongside the main Ethereum blockchain. To use it, you can \"bridge\" some of your crypto over to Polygon, and then interact with a wide range of popular crypto apps that were once exclusive to the main Ethereum blockchain.",
      "What is MATIC?",
      "Polygon has its own cryptocurrency, called MATIC, which is used to pay fees on the Polygon network, for staking, and for governance (which means that MATIC holders get to vote on changes to Polygon). You can also buy and sell MATIC via Ai Earn and other exchanges.",

      "How does Polygon work?",
      "You can picture Polygon as being like an express train on a subway — it travels along the same route as the regular train, but it makes fewer stops and thus moves much faster. (In this analogy the main Ethereum blockchain is the local train.) Polygon uses a variety of technologies to create this speedy parallel blockchain and link it to the main Ethereum blockchain.",

Becoming a validator is a commitment that requires running a full-time node (or computer) and staking your own MATIC. If you make an error or act maliciously (or even if your internet connection is glitchy) you could lose some of your staked MATIC.",
      " Delegators ",
      "stake their MATIC indirectly via a trusted validator. This is a much lower-commitment version of staking. But it still requires research — if the validator you pick acts maliciously or makes errors you could lose some or all of your staked MATIC.",
      "How do you use the Polygon network?",
      "The Polygon network allows you to do many of the same things the main Ethereum network allows, but with fees that are often a fraction of a cent. You can try decentralized exchanges like QuikSwap or SushiSwap, yield-generating lending and savings protocols like Aave, NFT markets like OpenSea, or even \"no-loss prize games\" like Pooltogether.",
      "To try the Polygon network, you need to send some crypto to a compatible crypto wallet like Ai Earn Wallet. You can then \"bridge\" some of your crypto — stablecoins are a popular choice for this — to the Polygon network. You’ll also need to bridge some MATIC to make transactions, but even a dollar’s worth is plenty because fees are so low.",

      "How does Polkadot work?",
      "The reason Polkadot can process all of this information is because the many parachains do a lot of the heavy lifting for the main relay chain. As a result, the Polkadot network can process more than 1,000 transactions per second, compared to about 7 for Bitcoin and 30 for Ethereum. As the network grows and more parachains are added, Polkadot should get even faster, with speeds that could hit a million transactions per second.",

      " The relay chain is responsible for achieving consensus and transaction delivery ... among parachains. Parachains … are application-specific blockchains within the Polkadot network. Each parachain is an entire blockchain in and of itself, with its own logic and features. ",
      "How does staking work on Polkadot?",
      "Polkadot uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism (as opposed to the proof-of-work system Bitcoin uses) to secure the network, verify transactions, and create and distribute new DOT. There are several ways DOT holders can interact with staking system — depending on how much time, technical knowledge, and money they want to devote.",
      " Validators ",

To become a validator, you need to run a node (one of the computers that makes up the network) with little to no downtime and stake a substantial amount of your own DOT. In exchange, you get the right to verify legitimate transactions, add new \"blocks\" of transactions to the relay chain, and potentially earn newly created DOT, a cut of transaction fees, and tips. (On the flip side, you can also forfeit some or all of your staked DOT for acting maliciously, making a mistake, or even having technical difficulties).",
      " Nominators ",
      "allow regular investors to participate in staking indirectly. You can delegate some of your DOT to a validator you trust to behave according to the rules. In exchange, you get a cut of DOT earned by your chosen validators. Be careful with who you choose: you also can forfeit some of your stake if your validator breaks the rules.",
      "There are also two specialized roles that typically require less of a commitment than becoming a full validator but more technical skill than is required to be a nominator: ",

      "keep track of valid parachain transactions and submit them to the relay chain validators.",
      " Fishermen ",
      "help find and report bad behavior across the network.",
      "By staking and participating in the network via any of the above roles, you may be able to receive DOT rewards. DOT holders also have a say in the governance of the network and are able to vote on proposed software upgrades.",
      "Who created Polkadot?",

      "Impermanent Loss",
      "Gas Fees",

This is not a comprehensive description of every risk associated with every DeFi investment, but it can serve as a foundation for considering some of the largest risks of a DeFi investment.",
      "Software Risk",
      "DeFi protocols are software applications that run on the internet, generally with very little human oversight, and often with millions or billions of dollars flowing through them. Like all software, DeFi protocols have two main software risks – coding errors, \"bugs,\" that may cause the software to malfunction, and security vulnerabilities that allow thieves, \"hackers,\" to break in and steal funds from the protocol.",
      "For example, a bug in the Alchemix lending protocol allowed borrowers to reclaim loan collateral worth over $6M…",
      " without repaying their loans ",
      ". Software security vulnerabilities can also destroy your DeFi investments. Many relatively reputable DeFi protocols, including Yearn Finance and Pickle Finance, have been victimized by hackers exploiting security vulnerabilities in their software to steal investors' funds. Thorchain was robbed twice in",
      " one week ",
      "While",
      " Yearn ",
      " Pickle ",
      "and Thorchain all elected to repay the victims of their thefts, they were not required to do so, and the repayments were not all instantaneous. You should assume that if you invest in a DeFi protocol and hackers steal your investment funds, your money will be gone.",
      "There is no guaranteed method to avoid Software Risk in a DeFi investment, but there are ways to reduce it. You may notice that brand new DeFi protocols offer extremely high rates of return on investments, sometimes 1,000% or 2,000%. While those numbers are enticing, remember that the higher the investment return, the higher the risk.",
      "In general, DeFi protocols with higher deposits and longer track records may have less Software Risk than newer or smaller DeFi protocols. This is because a new piece of software is like a new car model – it takes time for the engineers to work out the kinks.",
      "Longer running DeFi protocols have had more time to discover and repair problems with their software. And larger protocols are more likely to attract negative attention from hackers than smaller protocols. You can assume that larger protocols face frequent, if not constant, attacks on their security. If they have operated for months without suffering a security failure, it may suggest that their software security is reasonably sound.",
      "So, it is fair to say that a DeFi protocol that has operated for over a year and has over $1B of total value locked in the protocol probably has less software risk than a DeFi protocol that launched two months ago and has $100M of total value locked in the protocol.",
      "Before you invest in a DeFi protocol, make sure you know how long it has been operating and the size of its total deposits. You can also check its website to see if it has taken reasonable steps to minimize its Software Risk, such as conducting code audits (paying independent security companies to review its software) and offering bug bounties (reward payments to anyone who identifies a bug in the protocol's software). You can also search the internet for news stories about the protocol being hacked.",
      "If the protocol has been hacked, then find out when it happened, how the protocol's operators responded to it, and what steps they took to prevent it from happening again. That information can help you determine whether to trust the protocol with your money.",
      "To be clear, there is no DeFi investment with zero Software Risk. But these considerations can help you evaluate how significant the Software Risk might be for a given DeFi protocol.",
      "Counterparty Risk",
      "Any loan agreement, in or out of the DeFi ecosystem, involves counterparty risk, which is the risk of loaning money to someone who does not repay. Most of the large DeFi lending protocols, including Aave, Compound, and Maker, require that borrowers over-collateralize their loans, meaning that borrowers must provide collateral worth over 100% of the borrowed amount.",
      "Before you invest in a DeFi lending protocol, make sure you understand who will be borrowing your money (Individuals? Financial institutions?) and how its loans are collateralized (What percentage of collateral can a borrower withdraw? What types of collateral can borrowers post? Under what circumstances is the collateral liquidated?). These are basic questions to ask before depositing your money in a DeFi lending protocol.",
      "Token Risk",
      "Every DeFi investment involves certain cryptocurrency tokens. For example, if you deposit funds in a Uniswap liquidity pool, that investment exposes you to the two tokens in the pool, the liquidity provider token that you receive after making your deposit, and the Uniswap token that you receive as a reward. If you invest in a stablecoin pool, that pool likely has a combination of different stablecoins. Take the time to research each of the tokens involved (How long have they been trading? Are the organizations that created them reputable? If researching a stablecoin, is it collateralized by cash/cryptocurrency reserves, designed to maintain its value based on an algorithm, or both? If supported by reserves, how are the reserves held and where are they invested?). Each token in your DeFi investment has its own characteristics and its own risks. Take the time to find out what they are.",
      "Regulatory Risk",
      "Currently, DeFi protocols operate with almost no government oversight or regulation from any government entity. Simply put, this situation could change, and it is impossible to predict how any new government regulations of DeFi protocols might affect your DeFi investments.",
      "Impermanent Loss",
      "Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) calculate the prices of tokens in a liquidity pool differently than how the prices are calculated on the open market. When the prices of tokens in a liquidity pool change at different rates – for example, if one token rapidly increases or decreases in value while the other remains relatively stable – then the DEX will recalibrate the value of the tokens in the liquidity pool in such a way that the tokens in the pool will be worth less than they would be on the open market. Although you would be earning rewards from the DeFi protocol for depositing your tokens in the liquidity pool, you may encounter a situation where you would have made more money by simply holding your tokens instead of depositing them in a liquidity pool.",
      "Cryptocurrency prices are notoriously volatile, so it is very difficult to predict whether the prices of any two cryptocurrencies will rise or fall in the future, or at what rates. However, you can search the internet for an impermanent loss calculator to conduct a \"backtest,\" an experiment to determine how your investment would have performed based on historical data.",
      "Look up the old price data for your two tokens on Ai Earn.com – if you had deposited your tokens in a liquidity pool on a certain date in the past, and withdrawn them a few weeks or months later, how much impermanent loss would you have incurred? Now compare that number to your expected returns from the investment. If your liquidity pool promises you an APY of 40%, and your impermanent loss over the past year would have been 35%, then that would have been a profitable investment, although maybe not as profitable as you expected.",
      "As noted, cryptocurrency prices are volatile, so past performance is not indicative of future returns. But this backtest at least gives you information on how the tokens in your pool have performed in the past. Are their prices correlated (do they tend to rise and fall together)? Does one tend to rise or fall faster than the other? Of course, newer tokens will have less historical price data available than older tokens. You can consider this lack of historical information in assessing the risk of a given investment.",
      "One way to avoid impermanent loss in your DeFi investments is by investing in either liquidity pools with only one token. If there is only one token in the pool, then there is no way for two prices to rise or fall at different rates and cause impermanent loss. Another way to avoid impermanent loss is by investing in liquidity pools that consist only of dollar-pegged stablecoins. Since all of these tokens are designed to always maintain a value of $1 per coin, their prices should not fluctuate and there should be no impermanent loss in the pool.",
      "Impermanent loss is complicated and difficult to calculate, but hopefully, these considerations allow you to evaluate it without feeling overwhelmed by it.",
      "Gas Fees",
      "While DeFi protocols now run on many blockchains, some of which offer very low transaction fees, most of the largest DeFi protocols run on Ethereum. Unfortunately, on Ethereum transaction fees, called \"gas fees,\" can be very high to deposit funds in a DeFi protocol. This is especially true if your DeFi investment requires more than one step to complete, as most do. It\'s important to consider whether gas fees will outstrip your likely investment returns. For example, if you expect to earn 10% interest per year on an investment, and your gas fee is equal to 10% of the investment, then it will take you a year just to break even.",
      "Et ",
      " here  ",
      "um is implementing changes to permanently reduce gas fees that you can read about",
      " here ",
      ". In the meantime, while it's exciting to invest in DeFi and frustrating to be stymied by gas fees, don't let gas fees devour your potential investment returns.",
      "Outsmarting Yourself",
      "Fundamentally, cryptocurrency investing can be compared to commodity investing, and commodity investing is complicated. DeFi protocols and blockchain technology are also complicated. In addition, most commodities – gold, oil, pork bellies – have existed for centuries, and most commodities markets have existed for at least one century. Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is only about ten years old. And the DeFi did not become popular until 2020.",
      "So, investing in DeFi protocols is not only complicated, it is also brand new. Consequently, even if you understand the known risks of engaging with DeFi (or think you do), you still don’t know the unknown risks of DeFi investing that have not yet come to light. Keep in mind that while more complicated DeFi investments may be more fun to try, or offer higher rewards, they may also be more difficult to understand and riskier.",
      "If you’re investing in DeFi, or even considering it, then you’re already on the cutting edge of commodities and technology investing. Don’t push yourself past the limits of your understanding or your investment risk tolerance. You can start with simpler DeFi investments – single token pools or stablecoin pairs – and advance to more complicated investments as you learn. You can start with small investments and build your DeFi portfolio as you see how your investments perform. Don’t outsmart yourself by trying to do too much too fast.",

      "What is an L2?",
      "Layer 2 (L2) is a network or channel that sits on top of a Layer 1 (L1) network like Bitcoin or Ethereum. L2's are designed to enhance the speed and reduce the cost of performing transactions on a blockchain. L2s improve blockchain scalability by reducing the number of nodes or participants required to validate transactions within the L2 network, thereby reducing the time it takes to achieve consensus.",
      "All confirmed transactions on an L2 are periodically batched together and submitted back to the L1 where they are validated as one large transaction and added to the next block on the L1 chain.",

      "Over a million Ai Earn Wallet customers are using decentralized finance apps such as Uniswap, Compound and Aave, and NFT platforms like OpenSea and Zora.",
      "However, there are often high transaction fees and long confirmation times. In addition,users with smaller transactions can be priced out of being able to participate in the open financial system. This has made the need for accessible scaling solutions even more important. This integration will allow for faster and cheaper transactions, and provide easier access to decentralized innovation.",

      "The merge involves swapping out Ethereum’s PoW consensus method with PoS. The Ethereum community has been running PoS consensus for Ethereum for nearly two years as a separate chain called the Beacon Chain. The Ethereum execution layer (where the EVM, dapps, and users live) will remain the same, but the consensus layer will now leverage PoS instead of PoW.",

      "Post merge, any ETH you have staked including accrued staking rewards will remain locked on the Beacon Chain without the ability to withdraw.

This means that newly issued ETH, though accumulating on the Beacon Chain, will remain locked and illiquid for at least 6-12 months following The Merge.",

Note that the price of cbETH is determined by the market. To learn more about cbETH please visit our help center article - using cbeth.",
      "Will The Merge improve transaction speeds on the Ethereum network?",
      "Though some slight changes may exist, transaction speed will mostly remain the same on the Ethereum Mainnet. During the next phases of the upgrade, Ethreum plans to introduce new techniques (such as",
      " sharding ",
      "and rollups) that will enable the network to spread its computing load across multiple chains in order to alleviate congestion.",
      "These upgrades are designed to help the Ethereum Mainnet support thousands of transactions per second while reducing gas fees.",

      "Although the Merge is expected to be seamless from a user perspective, this downtime allows us to ensure that the transition has been successfully reflected by our systems.

We recommend you don’t send your ETH to anyone in an attempt to \"upgrade to ETH2\" as there is no ETH2 token. Your assets will be safe and secure during this period and no action is required to upgrade on your part.",
      "For users who hold ETH on self-custody wallets like Ai Earn Wallet or Metamask, we recommend exercising caution before signing any transactions relating to airdropped tokens, especially any airdrop purporting to be ETHPoW tokens. Scammers may send fake tokens to random wallets in an attempt to steal your funds once you approve the transaction.",
      "If a new token is airdropped to your wallet after the merge, make sure to first review the contract address and check official social media channels before taking any action.",
      "It is recommended that you refrain from connecting your self-custody wallet to the EthPoW network (or the network of any other chain fork of Ethereum). Transactions on such networks may lead to the loss of your funds on the main Ethereum network.",
      "Where can I view my staked ETH2 balance after the merge?",
      "Sometime after the Merge, you will find your staked ETH (ETH2) balance under your Ethereum (ETH) wallet on the platform. Your staked ETH will be listed separately from any unstaked ETH or dapp wallet ETH balance you might be holding.",
      "Staked ETH (ETH2) balances won’t be unlocked at the time of the Merge or be available to trade or transfer until the Ethereum protocol upgrade completes. The upgrade is anticipated to be completed by early 2023.",

      "What is Slippage?",
      "Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order actually executes. The slippage percentage shows how much the price for a specific asset has moved. Due to the volatility of cryptocurrency, the price of an asset can fluctuate often depending on trade volume and activity. Slippage is also affected by the depth of liquidity, which is the amount of an asset that is available to buy or sell at a given price. So if there is low liquidity or low trading activity in the market for a specific asset, then the slippage percentage will be higher.",
      "Why is the exchange rate different than expected?",
      "Sometimes, the exchange rate on DEXs for a pair of tokens might not always align with the rate for the same pair on other exchanges.",
      "This mismatch in pricing can be caused by several factors, including: ",
      "High market volatility",
      "Large and fast movements in price across different assets can sometimes cause Oracles that deliver pricing data for tokens into the blockchain to temporarily go out of sync with the broader market due to latency, resulting in a different exchange rate.",
      "Fluctuation in the supply of tokens in the liquidity pool",
      "If the supply of a token in a liquidity pool is significantly lowered relative to the pair it is trading against, or in the opposite case, if there is a flood of supply of one token relative to its trading pair,this can impact the trading price of the token and its exchange rate.",
      "Exchange rate differences are typically resolved after a short period of time. You can simply wait for market volatility to come down or for the token price in the pool to fall back in line with the broader market price before attempting the transaction again.",

The list of nodes is stored in an Ethereum smart contract that is decentralized and accessible to anyone around the world. Payment for bandwidth is done entirely with an ERC-20 token called OXT. To use Orchid, users need OXT, the Orchid app, and a Web3 crypto wallet.",

      "What is slippage?",
      "Slippage is when the price of an order executes at a drastically higher or lower price than you expected. Due to the volatility of cryptocurrency, the price of an asset can fluctuate often depending on trade volume and activity. If the bid-ask spread on the exchange \"slips\" more than 10%, then your order would be canceled.",
      "For example, if your ETH buy executes immediately at $1800 and the current market price is $1860, but the price goes down to $1841.40, this is slippage and you’ll collect more ETH. In this example, the slippage percentage is 1% and your order would still execute.",

      "What causes slippage?",
      "Slippage is caused by the amount of liquidity, which is how quickly you can buy and sell an asset without impacting the price. So if there is low liquidity or low trading activity in the market for a specific asset, then the slippage percentage is higher.",

      "Due to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions. When making a Bitcoin payment, no sensitive information is required to be sent over the internet. There is very low risk of your financial information being compromised, or having your identity stolen.",

      "If you’re attempting to process a transaction directly on the Ethereum network, EIP-1559 will change the way the Ethereum network calculates and processes your network fee.",
      "How does EIP-1559 work?",
      "Under the original Ethereum gas fee system, users bid a random amount of money to pay for each transaction. When the network becomes busy, this system causes gas fees to become high and unpredictable.",
      "Under the new system, gas fees will have two components – a base fee and a tip. The base fee will be a standard charge that all users will pay. It will be calculated by the network based on network traffic. The tip will be an optional extra payment that users can pay to speed up their transactions.",
      "EIP-1559 also requires that the network burn all Ether tokens used to pay base fees. This procedure will reduce the total supply of Ether tokens, making Ether more scarce and therefore more valuable.",
      "What problems does EIP-1559 solve?",
      "Currently, Ethereum gas fees operate on a simple auction system that is unpredictable and inefficient. When an Ethereum user submits a transaction to the network, the user can pay any amount as a gas fee. Ethereum \"miners,\" Ethereum users whose computers validate network transactions, can process transactions in any order they choose. Naturally, miners prioritize those transactions with the highest gas fees.",
      "This system is similar to the way ride-sharing services calculate ride fees. When demand for rides is higher, prices go up for everyone who wants a ride. Similarly, when demand for Ethereum transactions rises, gas fees go up for everyone who wants to process a transaction. This dynamic pricing system helps control demand for limited resources, whether those resources are car rides or Ethereum miners.",
      "However, a problem arises when the Ethereum network becomes busy, such as when many users are trying to play a hit game or trade on a new decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. In that case, the current gas fee system can result in users trying to push their transactions through the congested network by paying absurdly high gas fees. When this happens, gas fees become unpredictable because users must guess how much to pay for a transaction.",
      "As Ethereum has gained new users, the network has become more congested, gas fees have become more volatile, and many users have inadvertently overpaid for their transactions. As a result, the Ethereum gas fee system has become steadily less efficient. EIP-1559 attempts to correct this inefficiency.",
      "How does EIP-1559 solve the problem of excessive gas fees?",
      "EIP-1559 changes gas fees into a system with two components – a \"base fee\" calculated by the system that all users will pay for regular transaction speed, and an optional \"tip\" that users can pay to speed up their transactions.",
      " Base fee: ",
      "The base fee will be a \"standard processing\" fee that all users will be required to pay for an Ethereum transaction. The Ethereum network will automatically calculate the base fee. When Ethereum network traffic is heavy, the base fee will increase, but this increase will be predictable and will be the same for all users, unlike the current system, in which gas fee increases are unpredictable and require users to guess how much to pay.",
      " Tip: ",
      "The tip will be an \"express processing\" fee that users can pay to speed up their transactions. This fee will be optional and determined by the user.",
      "This fee system is similar to a delivery service. When a person ships a package with a delivery service, they can pay a lower fee for regular delivery or a higher fee for express delivery. During busy times, like the holiday season, the delivery service may increase the standard delivery fee, but that increase will be set by the delivery company and will affect all customers equally. At any time, customers who want standard delivery can pay the standard delivery fee, and customers who want express delivery can pay an extra fee.",
      "Similarly, once Ethereum implements EIP-1559, users who want regular transaction processing speed can pay the base fee, and users who want faster transaction processing speed can add a tip. This system differs from the current Ethereum gas fee system, which has no standard fees, forcing users to guess how much to pay.",
      "How does EIP-1559 affect compensation for miners?",
      "On Ethereum, miners collect transaction fees as compensation for contributing the computing power that the network needs to process transactions. Under the current system, miners receive 100% of all transaction fees. EIP-1559 changes this system to require that Ethereum burn all Ether tokens used to pay base fees. Under the new system, miners will only receive the tips that users choose to contribute to accelerate their transactions.",
      "In the long term, by requiring the network to burn Ether tokens every time a user pays a base fee, EIP-1559 will cause a steady decline in the total supply of Ether tokens in circulation. This supply reduction will make Ether tokens rarer and therefore more valuable.",
      "How will EIP-1559 impact fees?",
      "EIP-1559 changes the transaction fee market for Ethereum from a first-price auction to a fixed-price sale. Transactions specify the maximum gas price they are willing to pay, as well as the portion of that gas price they are willing to pay to miners. The portion not paid to miners is burned. The Ethereum network intends for EIP-1559 to have the overall effect of stabilizing gas prices from block to block. Ai Earn will gradually roll out the new network fee structure to users.",

However, this process is often complicated and high-risk, and the annual percentage yield (APY) often leaves something to be desired. Therefore, AI Earn, based on a comprehensive analysis of various DeFi projects, proposes two types of investment: staking and DeFi yield. Through systematic analysis, AI Earn can automatically match high-yield and stable projects for diversified investment, and investors only need to authorize with one click to get a steady passive income, without the need for professional knowledge and complicated operations.",
